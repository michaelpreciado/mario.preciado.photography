# Mario Preciado Photography Portfolio

This is the codebase for the personal photography portfolio website.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing all page content.
- `css/style.css`: Contains all the styles for the website.
- `js/script.js`: Contains JavaScript for interactivity and animations.
- `images/`: Contains static images used in the site (like logos, icons).
- `images/portfolio/`: **Drop your portfolio images directly into this folder.** The website will automatically load images from here into the gallery sections.

## Adding Portfolio Images

1.  Prepare your images (optimize them for web use if possible).
2.  Place your image files directly into the `images/portfolio/` directory.
3.  The JavaScript code in `js/script.js` is responsible for finding these images and displaying them. (Note: Currently, the JS to load images is not yet implemented).

## Development

To view the website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
